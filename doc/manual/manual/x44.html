>It all started a rainy day when I decided to try writing some
xml pages to put on my web server. I started looking on google
to find some way to let apache parse the pages, and a whole
bounce of projects came up. I started downloading
.tar.gz, compiling, and testing them out... however, I couldn't
find anything that suit all my needs: one didn't process pi
instructions at all, the other one was not able to read 
xml to be parsed from php or cgi scripts, another one was
not able to load dtds nor to fetch xslt from http urls.</P
><P
>The situation was sad: there were tens of mod xslt available
but none of them had even a subset of ``standard'' features,
many add constraints like ``you cannot use php xml handling
functions, since they use the same xml library as php'',
and many others were just buggy and almost completely 
unmaintained. So, I took the most promising one, mod-xslt, 
written by Philipp Dunkel, and started adding
all the features I needed. However, at the time mod-xslt
run only on apache2, which was still quite buggy to my eyes.</P
><P
>So, I ended up almost completely rewriting mod-xslt (just
a few lines are still there..) and adding a whole bounce of
new features.</P
