>  To report a bug, just drop a mail to one of the mod-xslt mailing
  lists. This version of mod-xslt is quite new, and has been used
  on few platforms and operative systems... so, it is very important
  to us to get bug reports and users feedback, so please make sure,
  if you find a bug to drop us a mail.</P
><P
>  If you do so, please include as much information as you have: something
  like ``it doesn't work'' does not help us much in fixing the problem. What
  does not work? Can you configure it? Compile it? Install it? How did you
  configure Apache? How can you say it does not work? Are you trying to access
  a document on your web server? Which document? Under which folder? What kind
  of document is that? Is it a POST request or a GET request? Is it a static
  document or a dynamic one? Does it use DTDs? How is the xslt referenced?
  What do the logs say? ...</P
><P
>  Sometimes, it may be useful to have the .xml you used at hand, some other
  times it may be useful to get a dump of your client connection. In the
  first case, just attach your xml file. In the second, run something like
  ``tcpdump -nei eth0 -s 8192 -w ./file.dump host yourclientipaddress and port 80''
  to get a trace in ``file.dump''.</P

>  If you want to help mod-xslt development, just drop us a mail in one of
  the mailing lists. We are always happy to get new hands at work. </P
