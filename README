What is this?  
=============
  The tarball you just decompressed contains the sources
for mod-xslt2. mod-xslt2 is a server side module able to
parse xml data and apply xslt stylesheets on the fly.
  It has _many_ features and, at time of writing, can
be used with apache 1.3 and apache 2.0.
  The API provided allows to easily add support for other
web servers, and work is under way to provide a cgi-bin
wrapper and a proxy module.
  The main site for the mod-xslt2 project is

	http://www.mod-xslt2.com/

  where you can find documentation, this file and all
related material. To get help or to know more about
mod-xslt2, you can also subscribe to the mailing
