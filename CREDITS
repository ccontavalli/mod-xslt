  Many people contributed to the development of mod-xslt2
as it is today. Purpose of this file is to thank those 
people for the time they spent on mod-xslt2.

  The following people contributed to the rewrite
of mod-xslt2:

    o  Carlo Contavalli <ccontavalli at mod-xslt2.com>
    	    Wrote most of the code of the new mod-xslt2 version. The whole 
	    project to rewrite mod-xslt and most of the features that have 
	    been added are his ideas.
    o  Philipp Dunkel <philipp at dunkel.org>
	    He made available the original codebase. Huge thanks go to him.
    o  Josh Nutzman - <nutzman at users.sourceforge.net>
    o  Tom Murray - <yozhik at users.sourceforge.net>
	    For allowing me to continue their effort for mod-xslt on
	    sourceforge.net, and for working on a great release of
	    mod-xslt early in 2001.
    o  Marco Merlin <mmerlin at masobit.net>
	    For providing many xslt and xml files to test
	    mod-xslt2 with and for pointing out many on-the-field
	    problems. He is also the one who designed the interface
	    of this web site. Thanks!
    o  Gianni Carabelli <gcarabelli at masobit.net>
 	    For massively testing mod-xslt2 and for pointing out
	    pieces of broken code in the mime-type handling, PHP 
	    error handling, cookies & headers management, inclusion 
	    of external entities and xslt, variables and expressions 
	    handling. Well, he probably had fun playing with mod-xslt2 :-).
    o  Andrea Ciancone <aciancone at masobit.net>
	    Took care of the testing of the first releases,
	    pointing out some flaws and helping out the design
	    of new features.
    o  Riccardo Setti <giskard at autistici.org>
	    For setting this site up, creating the mailing lists,
	    for installing mod-xslt2 on many servers, and for pointing

    o  Peter Svanberg <psv at nada.kth.se>
     	    Provided updated nanohttp patch for libxml 2.6.16
	    and some useful feedbacks about running mod-xslt on
	    SunOS.
    o  The whole Masobit staff - http://www.masobit.net/
