  o  Coeherent behavior among different web servers,
     with great care to multithreading issues
  o  Allows you, from your xml documents, to choose
     which xslt to use based on get parameters or
     any header passed from the browser
  o  Good conformance with xslt specifications
     relatively to: escaping attributes, interpretation
     of xml-stylesheet PI, DTD interpretation
  o  DTD and external entity are loaded and used
     as specifyed by the ``standalone'' attribute
  o  DTD, xslt or any external entity can:
  	o  be fetched from a remote url
	o  be fetched from a file
	o  be fetched from a file like if
	   it was an URL
     This latest feature allows you to write
     php or cgi scripts able to provide both
     DTDs or xslt stylesheets
  o  Any header or get data is passed over
     to the xslt as parameters
  o  Ability to parse dinamically generated
     documents with the lowest overhead 
     possible
