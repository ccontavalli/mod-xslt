    <question>
    Configure outputs the error <output>error: C preprocessor [...] fails sanity check</output>
    what can I do?
    </question>

    <answer>
    Install a c++ compiler and the c++ library (g++, libstdc++, libstdc++-dev). This is due to
    the ``configure'' script being created with libtool &lt;= 1.5.x, which tests for the
    availability of a c++ compiler. This is a known libtool problem, and future versions of modxslt
    configure scripts will be created using libtool &gt;= 1.6. Either install a c++ compiler or
    recreate the ``configure'' script by yourself (using autoconf).

     I get the error: 
<output>
Cannot load /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_xslt.so into server: 
/usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_xslt.so: undefined symbol:

    <answer>
      <p>
      You are probably using an older version of libmodxslt0,
      or two or more versions of libmodxslt0 are available
      on your system and apache is using the older one.
     </p><p>
      To solve the problem, make sure to run ``make install''
      and to specify the correct --with-prefix to the 
      configure script (usually, --with-prefix=/usr),
      and to remove any older libmodxslt0.

    I can't compile mod-xslt with the xxx compiler. The compiler complains about: .... What
    can I do?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    mod-xslt uses some ISO C99 constructs that are supported by very few compilers. You 
    should:
    <itemize>
      <item>use gcc, which has supported them for quite a while now</item>
      <item>from your source tree, run ``./helpers/c99.sh'', a small script able to strip 
      	    away all c99 constructs used by mod-xslt. After running ``c99.sh'', it should
	    compile with any ANSI compiler.</item>
    </itemize>
    If your compiler is not ANSI, go and get one. This is your problem.

    Configure complains about libxml2 not providing ``setGlobalState'', by printing a message
    like ``Your libxml2 does not provide a setGlobalState'', what's wrong?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    Althought libxml2 is thread safe and libxslt is not very thread sensitive, they both suffer
    some problems if used ``from modules'' by web servers like apache or apache2 (take a look
    to the thread on the libxml and libxslt mailing lists).</p>
    <p>
    mod-xslt tries to lessen the impact of libxml/libxslt lack of support for modularized 
    environments by trying to use some libxml2 internal functions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The message just warns you that some compatibility layers have been enabled since some
    of the needed functions were missing. If you want to get rid of the warning, please patch 
    the library (read README-Patches.sgml). Most of the times, you can just ignore this message
    since the ``compatibility layer'' will take care of everything.

    I am configuring mod-xslt using ``--with-sapi=apacheX''. However, configure detects and 
    uses the apxs for some other version of apache, causing the build process to fail...
    </question>

    <answer>
    You should also specify ``--with-apxs=...'' to force configure to use the right apxs.
    Without this parameter, configure will use the first apxs detected on your system,
    even if it is of the wrong apache version.

    <question>
    You lyar! You told me mod-xslt was able to parse dynamically generated
    .xml documents, using dinamically generated .xsl files, but it doesn't work...
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    By default, mod-xslt will try to fetch any external entity using 
    directly the file system (which is kind of faster). However, if the 
    file system is used, php, perl, ssi, are not parsed and the document 
    is used raw as it is.</p><p>
    If you want to use dynamically generated stylesheets, use a http:// or
    local:// url, so mod-xslt will load the document by asking the
    web server for it.</p>
    <p>
    If you want to use dynamically generated xml files, tell mod-xslt
    about that. To know how, take a deeper look to the manual. It seems
    like you need it.</p>

    Try to update your libxslt. Version up to 1.1.11
    have a problem in handling doctype-public and doctype-system

    <question>
    I often see in my logs errors like ``missing DTD''. However, I get
    this error only for certain documents. What's going on?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    mod-xslt doesn't care about the validity of documents. It just check
    for them to be ``well-formed''. However, DTDs may specify default values
    for some attributes or external entities, so they need to be loaded. 
    However, loading one more additional file may slow things down, especially
    if DTDs are stored remotely. mod-xslt will thus try to load DTDs only  
    if you specify the ``standalone="no"'' attribute in the xml declaration
    of your document.</p>
    <p>
    Just set ``standalone'' to ``yes'' if you don't want mod-xslt to even 
    try to load the DTD.

      The media-type attribute of xsl:output seems to be ignored

    <answer>
      <p>
      There's currently a bug being investigated either in libxslt or 
      mod-xslt2, such as xsl:output elements in imported documents
      are ignored...
      </p>

      <p>
      A workaround is just to put xsl:output in the main .xsl stylesheet,

    <question>
    Some errors in my .xslt documents cause a ``500'' status
    page while others cause a partial output (like half a html page)
    to be generated. How come? Is this a bug? Is this correct?
    </question>

    <answer><p>
    No, it is not. You get a 500 error page when the xslt is not valid xml (it is not
    well-formed), contains invalid xsl instructions or when it cannot get parsed <bf>at 
    all</bf> (when no output could be generated). You get as much of the output as possible 
    when there is an error in your XPath expressions
    or a non fatal error in your templates. Take a look to your web server logs to
    know what exactly is going on. 
    </p></answer>

    <question>
    My .xml document is not parsed, I get a 500 Server Error. I can see some wierd
    errors in the log about my DTDs, but the document is ``valid''. What can I do?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    mod-xslt <bf>does not</bf> check for document validitity (it doesn't care
    about it). However, it does load external DTDs when ``&lt;xml version... standalone="no"''.
    </p>
    <p>
    When a locally stored DTD (== on a locally mounted disk) cannot be read for some 
    reason an error is printed in the logs but parsing goes on.
    When the DTD is fetched from a remote URL, the error is fatal and 
    parsing is stopped with a 500 error status.
    </p>
    <p>
    If this is the case, you'll see in your logs something like:
    <output>
mod_xslt: http://127.0.0.1/yaslt/fuffa/dtd/faq.dtd:1:
mod_xslt: Content error in the external subset
mod_xslt: &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"&gt;
mod_xslt: ^
mod_xslt: http://127.0.0.1/yaslt/fuffa/dtd/faq.dtd:1:
mod_xslt: Extra content at the end of the document
mod_xslt: &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"&gt;
mod_xslt: ^
    </output>
    Does this look familiar to you? This is not my fault. libxml2 http 
    client does not check for the status of remote servers, and tries to 
    parse any returned document, even when the returned document is an error 
    page (like those returned by a 400 or 500 status).  </p>
    <p>
    However, when a DTD is not available nothing bad happens, while if it
    is available but it is not a valid DTD (contains junk, trash, fuffa, html
    or something that does not make it a valid DTD), a fatal error arise.
    </p><p>
    At time of writing, and according to the libxml (2.5.9) mailing list, the
    lack of check of the status of remote servers and the lack of an API to
    allow users to decide how to handle error pages is a ``feature''.
    </p><p>
    Furthermore, I couldn't find any good way to disable this feature, that
    didn't involve patching the library or rewriting the whole http client
    (which is something I'm not going to do).
    </p><p>
    If this problem really annoies you, patch your library and let your voice be 
    heard by the upstream team.

    <question>
    I'm using XSLTSetStylesheet and XSLTDefaultStylesheet from my web server
    configuration files, but I keep getting errors like: 
    <output>
    fatal - no &lt;?xml-stylesheet or &lt;?modxslt-stylesheet found in ...
    </output>
    what am I doing wrong?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
      The most common source of errors is the MimeType specified with 
      XSLTSetStylesheet or XSLTDefaultStylesheet. Infact, both parameters 
      must be followed by the mime type <bf>of the document the stylesheet
      is to be applied to</bf>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, mime types are configurable for most web 
      servers, so it is quite easy to specify the wrong mime type
      for the given document. As an example, if we want to apply
      stylesheet.xsl to all .xml documents, we need to use something
      like:
<code>
  [...]
  XSLTSetStylesheet application/xml stylesheet.xsl
  [...]
</code>
      or
<code>
  XSLTSetStylesheet text/xml stylesheet.xsl
</code>
      to tell your web server you want all documents of type
      text/xml and application/xml to be transformed by applying
      stylesheet.xsl...
    </p>

    <p>
      Web servers like apache use parameters like AddType to
      decide which mime type to use for every document, or
      files like /etc/mime.types.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember: XSLTSetStylesheet forces the usage of a given
      stylesheet for a given kind of documents, where the document
      kind is indicated thanks to its mime type. XSLTDefaultStylesheet
      provides a stylesheet to be used in case there is no XSLTSetStylesheet
      and no stylesheet is specified in the document itself.

    Uhm... in the log, I see tons of messages like: 
    <output>
mod_xslt: xsltApplyOneTemplate: fallback was not compiled
    </output>
    what does this mean?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    It just means you're using a &lt;xsl:fallback... tag under
    a &lt;mod-xslt:header tag, or in a ``strange'' place (like as 
    a top element).</p><p>
    I believe it to be a libxml2 bug, which I already took
    care of reporting.</p><p>
    However, at time of writing it has not been corrected (libxml 2.5.9).
    </p><p>
    To avoid the problem, that under some conditions may cause a Segmentation
    Fault, you can rely on some dirty hacks provided by
    mod-xslt.</p><p>
    The Segmentation Fault is caused by yet another bug that sometimes
    combines badly with this bug: the ``xsltApplyOneTemplate: fallback ...''
    error message is printed by libxml by calling the application error handler
    by using the arguments of the debug handler.</p><p>
    This latest problem is detected by mod-xslt code most of the times.
    However, to get rid of both problems forever, you should 1 - patch the 
    library to avoid error messages to be printed when the fallback tag is 
    correctly used 2 - patch the library to avoid the error handler to be 
    called with the debug arguments.</p><p>
    If you don't want to patch the library, you can enable two dirty
    hacks in mod-xslt: the first one will try to remove the fallback
    nodes where libxml would illegally comply, while the second one will
    enable the debug handler with the same arguments as the error handler,
    in order to always avoid the SEGFAULT.</p>

    I'm having a hard time matching regular expressions which use
    the ``&amp;'' character as separator (instead of the standard ``/''), what can I do?
    </question>

    <answer>
    The ``&amp;'' character has a special meaning in XML. Since it is used
    inside the attribute of a tag, it is interpreted by the xml parsing library
    as a special character. If you want to use ``&amp;'' as a separator, you
    need to use a regular expression like ``&amp;amp;[a-z]+[0-9]{2}&amp;amp;i''
    which is exactly equivalent to ``/[a-z]+[0-9]{2}/i''.

    Uhm... file://, http://localhost/... why bothering 
    with local://?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <itemize>
      <item><bf>file://</bf> - asks for a stylesheet or for an entity to be 
      		loaded directly by mod-xslt by reading the local file system. 
		Path will be calculated 
		starting from the root of the file system if a third ``/'' is 
		specified, otherwise it will be taken as a relative path from 
		the current directory (the real directory of the xml file being parsed).
		<bf>By default</bf>, if no scheme is specified, the path is
		assumed to be relative to the file system.
		</item>
      <item><bf>http://localhost/</bf> - asks for a stylesheet or for an entity
      		to be taken from the specifyed host (in this case localhost) using
		the http protocol. </item>
      <item><bf>local://</bf> - is similar to both ``http://'' and ``file://'', 
      		in the sense that the specified file will be accessed by using
		the http protocol, but... the name of the server will be that of the 
		virtual host that received the request, and if the path doesn't
		start with a ``/'' (leading to something like local:///file.html),
		the url will be considered as relative to the current page.
		This is useful when you have, for example, php scripts generating .xsl
		files or .DTD.</item>
    </itemize>
    Reading the <bf>README</bf> for more details is strongly encouraged. As an
    example, imagine a browser requesting ``www.site.com/your/path/to/file.xml''.
    If, in file.xml, you have ``local://file.xsl'', file.xsl will be accessed
    using http as if it was ``http://www.site.com/your/path/to/file.xsl''.
    If instead we had ``local:///file.xsl'', the address would be:
    ``http://www.site.com/file.xsl''. Note that, for various concerns, the
    name of the virtual host (www.site.com) is taken from the ServerName
    parameter in apache.

    I often get Segmentation Faults while using mod-xslt... what can
    I do?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    There's <bf>only one known</bf> condition in which case mod-xslt will crash
    with segmentation fault, and it's not mod-xslt fault.</p><p>
    The problem is caused by libxslt calling the ``error'' handler with the
    arguments of the ``debug'' handler under certain conditions.
    mod-xslt cannot really detect when this error verifies, but some ``parachutes'' 
    have been written to avoid this problem <it>most</it> of 
    the times.</p><p>
    To get rid of the problem, you should patch libxslt.
    </p><p>
    However, keep in mind that the highlited segfault will always be
    triggered by an error in your xslt file, error that is ``printed 
    uncorrectly'' by the libxslt library.</p><p>
    If you don't want to patch libxslt, you can compile mod-xslt
    with ``--enable-libxslt-hack''. By enabling this option, mod-xslt will 
    enable libxslt debugging by specifying an handler which accepts
    the same arguments as the error one.</p><p>
    However, with debugging enabled, the debug function will always be
    called (even if the output is discarded), and may possibly slow things
    down.</p><p>
    If this error really bothers you, you'd be better patch

      What's the difference between XSLTAddFilter and XSLTAddForce? 
    </question>

    <answer>
      <p>
        XSLTAddFilter tells mod-xslt to watch a given mime type to see
	if, after being executed by apache, it outputs xml code to be
	parsed.
      </p>

      <p>
        XSLTAddForce tells mod-xslt to parse anything sent as output
	by apache while parsing the given mime type.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only difference between the two is that the first one
	looks at the output mime type, and ignores the document
	if it is not text/xml, while the second one parses anything
	the script may send.

    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    When you configured and installed mod-xslt, you didn't specify
    the correct ``--prefix'' or ``--libdir''. This means that everything
    got compiled and installed correctly, but that your system is not able 
    to find the installed libraries since they have not been placed
    in the directories it is looking into.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to solve the problem, either:
    <itemize>
      <item>specify something like --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/usr, to
	get the libraries installed in /usr/lib, one of the directories
        most system look into to search for libraries (thanks to 
        Boyan Dzambazov).</item>
      <item>specify something like --libdir=/usr/lib, to manually force
	the place where you want mod-xslt libraries to be installed.</item>
      <item>on linux, add the line ``/usr/local/lib'' into the configuration
	file <file>/etc/ld.so.conf</file> and run the command ``ldconfig'',

    you should ignore this warning.
    </p>
    <p>
    In any other case, mod-xslt will try to lessen the impact of libxml2
    lack of support for modularized applications by using some libxml2 internal
    functions available only when libxml2 is compiled with threading support.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want to use other apache modules that are linked to libxml2, you
    should really make sure your libxml2 has been compiled with threading support.
    </p>
    <p>
    Even with threading support, however, some problems may arise, depending
    on how the other modules make use of libxml or libxslt.

    Use ``configure --with-sapi='apache1' --with-apxs='/path/to/apxs'''. 
    You can find where ``apxs'' is installed on your system by running 
    something like ``whereis apxs'', ``which apxs'', ``locate apxs'' or 
    ``find / -name apxs -perm +0100''.</p><p>
    Without the ``--with-apxs'' parameter, configure will try to use

	Can I use apache 2.x multithreaded mpms? Is mod-xslt

	</question>

	<answer>

	<p>Great care has been taken to keep mod-xslt thread safe,
	althrought some of the libraries it uses are not.
	Most of the problems were due to libxslt not supporting
	multithreaded applications (at time of writing - since

	apache request and requests are processed paralleley by
	multiple threads).</p>

        Take a look to your apache.conf or httpd.conf, whatever it is
        called on your system. You probably specified more than one
        ``AddOutputFilter'', ``SetOutputFilter'' or ``AddOutputFilterByType''.

        <p>
        You need to specify only <bf>one</bf> of those instructions, otherwise
        your xml files will be parsed by mod-xslt multiple times, one for each
        of the directives you used. And while at the first pass the html will
        be generated, during the second pass it would try to transform the html
        into something else, leading to the errors you are seeing.

	Apache is trying to parse my .xslt stylesheet as being
	a normal xml file, returning an error. What can I do?
	</question>

	<question>
	When parsing .xml files, mod-xslt complains with (apparentely)
	no reason for a ``subrequest failed'', and returns a 500 error
	page. What can I do?
	</question>

	<answer><p>
	In the log, you'll probably see something like:
	<output>
fatal - couldn't load stylesheet for: file.xsl
http://127.0.0.1/yaslt/xslt/file.xsl:1:
Space required after the Public Identifier
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"&gt;</output>
	</p><p>
        And, if you look carefully to the url of your stylesheet, you'll see
	that it is loaded from a ``http://'' or ``local://'' url. 
	</p>
	<p>
	This error usually shows up when the xsl file is stored in a mod-xslt
	handled directory, and is due to apache (correctly) believing 
	that both .xml and .xsl files are of type ``text/xml''.</p><p>
	When the xml file is parsed, the xsl file is fetched, but, as being
	fetched using a remote url, it is parsed again by apache. apache verifyes
	the file is of type ``text/xml'', and calls mod-xslt again to parse
	the stylesheet. However, the stylesheet cannot be parsed since 
	it does not contain xml-stylesheet or modxslt-stylesheet
	directive, causing the sub-request to fail and mod-xslt to return a 500 error 
	page, which, in turn, cannot be used by mod-xslt as a .xslt stylesheet (as not
	being even a valid .xml page).
	</p>
	<p>
	To solve the problem, either disable mod-xslt in the directories where
	you store .xsl files or tell apache ``.xsl'' files are of type
	``text/xsl'', using something like:
	<code>
	AddType text/xsl .xsl
	</code>

    A document using local:// url doesn't seem to work, even though the .xml file

    </question>

    <answer>
    For apache, local:// gets replaced with the name of the server the request
    came from. Under certain circumstances, the server name used is the one
    specified by the ServerName parameter in httpd.conf file. If that parameter
    is wrongly configured, than the local:// request might fail. The error
    you see in the log will be the one corresponding to the http error encountered
    (most likely, "No such file or directory", meaning that the file is not there).

    Take the number and run the command (from your console) ``modxslt-perror x''. It will tell

    When I try to access a document parsed by mod-xslt using my browser, I get an
    error like ``XML Parsing Error''. What can I do to solve the problem?
    </question>

    <answer>
    In your stylesheet, add the following xsl instruction:
    <code>
  &lt;xsl:output
    method="html"
    omit-xml-declaration="yes"
    encoding="UTF-8"
    indent="no"
    doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" /&gt;
    </code>
Unless you use the above xsl instructions, the xsl processor assumes that
the output will still be valid xml, and prepends the correct xml headers.
The browser, when receiving the document, thinks that the document is still
.xml, and tries to parse it.

    I have installed mod_xslt correctly, but every time I try to access a particular
    page I get a ``Server Error'' (500 server status). How come?
    </question>

    <answer>
    For security reasons mod-xslt won't disclose any information about the errors
    in your xml pages, and will return a 500 error page when:
    <itemize>
      <item>the file being parsed by mod-xslt is not a valid XML file</item>
      <item>a valid XSLT cannot be found</item>
      <item>the XSLT is having troubles translating the given XML file</item>
    </itemize>
    <p>
    When you ask mod_xslt to parse a file, that file will either be parsed or an error 
    given back to the user. mod-xslt won't give away the source of your xml files or 
    any information about the errors they contain (unless you ask for it). If you want 
    to know what caused mod-xslt to return the error, read the error.log of your 
    server.</p> 
    If you want to return the xml source, just disable mod-xslt for the given file, 
    using
    <itemize>
      <item>in apache 1.3.x: the apache &lt;file&gt; directive or set the mime
	    type to text/plain.</item>
    </itemize>
    You can also use the &lt;modxslt-stylesheet pi without any href to tell mod-xslt
    you don't want any xslt to be used.

    <question>
    I don't usually have any problem using mod-xslt. However, I sometimes (apparently
    randomly) get a ``Server Error'' when trying to access a particular php/perl/... 
    document. What can I do? 
    </question>

    <answer><p>
    I got several questions like this, and most of the times they were related to the 
    language parser generating errors in the ``html'' output. Consider php as an
    example: when an error verifies in your code, like a wrong mysql query or something
    similar, php inserts an error text in what it thinks to be an html document. 
    However, the document is not html and the error text is not written using valid xml,
    causing mod-xslt to complain about the validity of the xml document.</p><p> 
    However, the xml will be invalid only when your code encounters an error, leading to 
    ``random'' errors from ``mod-xslt''. To trace the problem down, I suggest you take
    a good look to the error log and disable the unlinking of temporary files or enable
    the store of ``intermediate files'' (depends on the SAPI being used). In the temporary 
    file, you will get the xml file generated by your script that mod-xslt had to parse.

    I have some xml documents using a given xslt. The xslt exists and the
    paths are all correct, however, I keep getting a ``Server Error'',
    (500 server status), even if the documents are all valid. What can I do?
    </question>

    <answer>
    <p>
    This problem often shows up when the privileges of the web server
    do not allow it to access the xslt document or any external entity
    required by the xml document. In the error log, you should see something
    like:
    <output>
failed to load external entity "name.xsl"
fatal - couldn't apply stylesheet to: /tmp/name.tmp (file.xml)
    </output>
    As shown in the messages above, libxslt is not able to open ``name.xsl''. 
    In this case ``name.xsl'' either does not exist or cannot be opened
    by the web server for privilege problems (verify the .xsl file can be read by the
    web server!).</p>
