  <para>                                                 
    This whole site is a proof of concept of mod-xslt usage.
    It was written entirely in .xml + .xsl by using mod-xslt 
    features. 
  </para> 

  <para>
    In the future, we would like to release the .xml and .xsl
    files we used as a generalized way to build up internet
    sites, as a raw and simple version of a Content Management
    System. 
  </para>

  <para>
    However, lot of works still needs to be done, both to cleanup 
    the code, to make it easyer to customize
    and to add support for more features (like php scripts to modify
    the layout of menus and boxes). If you like it and would like to 
    help us out, just let us know (write to the mailing lists or contact
    one of the authors, either Marco Merlin or Carlo Contavalli).
  </para>

  <para>
    All the .xsl files and .xml files are released under GPL, so,
    if you want to test them out or take a look at them before
    they are released, drop us a mail. They will be made available
    on this site as soon as they are completed.
  </para>

  <para>
    At time of writing, the stylesheets we wrote have been used
    for a couple other sites:
  </para>
  <para>
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><bf><ulink url="http://www.masobit.net" /></bf><para>Masobit Corp SRL</para></listitem>
    <listitem><bf><ulink url="http://www.mod-xslt2.com" /></bf><para>mod-xslt2 web site</para></listitem>
    <listitem><bf><ulink url="http://www.pigeonair.net" /></bf><para>Pigeonair Mail System</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    If you want to use them for your own site, or you want your site
    to be listed here, just let us know.
