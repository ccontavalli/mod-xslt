main idea:
  - apache style handling of connections, using
    threads

  - in memory cacheing of preloaded .xml files,
    .xslt stylesheets, and parsed result

  - chroot in a given read only directory, to avoid
    file/directory creation

  - eventually cache up results on disk using 
    some sort of directory hashing/encoding

  - connection cacheing using pools
