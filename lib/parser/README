Adding an operator:
	- add the operator to the lexer (file.lex)
	- modify the file .c in src/ to lookup the new operator
	  Originally, those files where generated with ``gperf'' and
	  hacked manually to improve performance. However, automatically
	  generated gperf files should be just fine, as long as the API
	  is respected
